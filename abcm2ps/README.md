Description
abcm2ps translates tunes written in the ABC music notation format to customary sheet musicscores in PostScript. It is based on abc2ps 1.2.5 and was developed mainly to print Baroque organ scores that have independent voices played on multiple keyboards and a pedal-board. The program has since been extended to support various other notation conventions in use for sheet music.
